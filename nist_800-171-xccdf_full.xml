      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Organizations identify systems that are affected by announced software and firmware flaws, including potential vulnerabilities that result from those flaws, and report this information to designated personnel with information security responsibilities. Security-relevant updates include patches, service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. Organizations address the flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error handling. Organizations can take advantage of available resources (e.g., CWE or CVE databases) when remediating system flaws. Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary based on a variety of factors, including the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation may require more testing than other types.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;</description>

      <title>Malicious Code Protection: Implement malicious code protection mechanisms at system entry and exit points to detect and eradicate malicious code.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities. Malicious code can be inserted into the system in a variety of ways, including email, the internet, and portable storage devices. Malicious code includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can be encoded in various formats, contained in compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using techniques such as steganography. Malicious code may be present in commercial off-the-shelf software and custom-built software and could include logic bombs, backdoors, and other types of attacks that could affect organizational mission and business functions. Periodic scans of the system and real-time scans of files from external sources as files are downloaded, opened, or executed can detect malicious code. Malicious code protection mechanisms can also monitor systems for anomalous or unexpected behaviors and take appropriate actions. Malicious code protection mechanisms include signature- and non-signature-based technologies. Non-signature-based detection mechanisms include artificial intelligence techniques that use heuristics to detect, analyze, and describe the characteristics or behavior of malicious code and to provide controls against such code for which signatures do not yet exist or for which existing signatures may not be effective. Malicious code for which active signatures do not yet exist or may be ineffective includes polymorphic malicious code (i.e., code that changes signatures when it replicates). Non-signature-based mechanisms include reputation-based technologies. Pervasive configuration management, anti-exploitation software, and software integrity controls may also be effective in preventing unauthorized code execution.  If malicious code cannot be detected by detection methods or technologies, organizations can rely on secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure that the software only performs intended functions. Organizations may determine that different actions are warranted in response to the detection of malicious code. For example, organizations can define actions to be taken in response to the detection of malicious code during scans, malicious downloads, or malicious activity when attempting to open or execute files.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;System monitoring involves external and internal monitoring. Internal monitoring includes the observation of events that occur within the system. External monitoring includes the observation of events that occur at the system boundary. Organizations can monitor the system by observing audit record activities in real time or by observing other system aspects, such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives may guide determination of the events. A system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., audit record monitoring software, intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, network monitoring software). Strategic locations for monitoring devices include selected perimeter locations and near server farms that support critical applications with such devices being employed at managed system interfaces. The granularity of monitoring the information collected is based on organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of the system to support such objectives. Systems connections can be network, remote, or local. A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a network (e.g., local area network, the internet). A remote connection is any connection with a device that communicates through an external network (e.g., the internet). Network, remote, and local connections can be either wired or wireless. Unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions related to inbound and outbound communications traffic include internal traffic that indicates the presence of malicious code in the system or propagating among system components, the unauthorized export of information, or signaling to external systems. Evidence of malicious code is used to identify a potentially compromised system. System monitoring requirements, including the need for types of system monitoring, may be referenced in other requirements.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;System monitoring involves external and internal monitoring. Internal monitoring includes the observation of events that occur within the system. External monitoring includes the observation of events that occur at the system boundary. Organizations can monitor the system by observing audit record activities in real time or by observing other system aspects, such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives may guide determination of the events. A system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., audit record monitoring software, intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, network monitoring software). Strategic locations for monitoring devices include selected perimeter locations and near server farms that support critical applications with such devices being employed at managed system interfaces. The granularity of monitoring the information collected is based on organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of the system to support such objectives. Systems connections can be network, remote, or local. A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a network (e.g., local area network, the internet). A remote connection is any connection with a device that communicates through an external network (e.g., the internet). Network, remote, and local connections can be either wired or wireless. Unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions related to inbound and outbound communications traffic include internal traffic that indicates the presence of malicious code in the system or propagating among system components, the unauthorized export of information, or signaling to external systems. Evidence of malicious code is used to identify a potentially compromised system. System monitoring requirements, including the need for types of system monitoring, may be referenced in other requirements.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;</description>

      <title>Literacy Training and Awareness: Provide security literacy training to system users:</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Organizations provide basic and advanced levels of security literacy training to system users (including managers, senior executives, system administrators, and contractors) and measures to test the knowledge level of users. Organizations determine the content of literacy training based on specific organizational requirements, the systems to which personnel have authorized access, and work environments (e.g., telework). The content includes an understanding of the need for security and the actions required of users to maintain security and respond to incidents. The content also addresses the need for operations security and the handling of CUI. Security awareness techniques include displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed with security reminders, generating email advisories or notices from organizational officials, displaying logon screen messages, and conducting awareness events using podcasts, videos, and webinars. Security literacy training is conducted at a frequency consistent with applicable laws, directives, regulations, and policies. Updating literacy training content on a regular basis ensures that the content remains relevant. Events that may precipitate an update to literacy training content include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Potential indicators and possible precursors of insider threats include behaviors such as inordinate, long-term job dissatisfaction; attempts to gain access to information that is not required for job performance; unexplained access to financial resources; sexual harassment or bullying of fellow employees; workplace violence; and other serious violations of the policies, procedures, rules, directives, or practices of organizations. Organizations may consider tailoring insider threat awareness topics to roles (e.g., training for managers may be focused on specific changes in the behavior of team members, while training for employees may be focused on more general observations). Social engineering is an attempt to deceive an individual into revealing information or taking an action that can be used to breach, compromise, or otherwise adversely impact a system. Social engineering includes phishing, pretexting, impersonation, baiting, quid pro quo, threadjacking, social media exploitation, and tailgating. Social mining is an attempt to gather information about the organization that may be used to support future attacks. Security literacy training includes how to communicate employee and management concerns regarding potential indicators of insider threat and potential and actual instances of social engineering and data mining through appropriate organizational channels in accordance with established policies and procedures.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;</description>

      <title>Vulnerability Monitoring and Scanning: Update system vulnerabilities to be scanned [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and when new vulnerabilities are identified and reported.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for system components and ensure that potential sources of vulnerabilities (e.g., networked printers, scanners, and copiers) are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software may require additional approaches, such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, or binary analysis. Organizations can use these approaches in source code reviews and tools (e.g., static analysis tools, web-based application scanners, binary analyzers). Vulnerability scanning includes scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating flow control mechanisms. To facilitate interoperability, organizations consider using scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention. Sources for vulnerability information also include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing, the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), and the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;</description>

Organizations may limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices, including devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other approved organizations, and devices that are not personally owned. Organizations may also control the use of portable storage devices based on the type of device — prohibiting the use of writeable, portable devices — and implement this restriction by disabling or removing the capability to write to such devices. Limits on the use of organization-controlled system media in external systems include restrictions on how the media may be used and under what conditions.

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Organizations provide basic and advanced levels of security literacy training to system users (including managers, senior executives, system administrators, and contractors) and measures to test the knowledge level of users. Organizations determine the content of literacy training based on specific organizational requirements, the systems to which personnel have authorized access, and work environments (e.g., telework). The content includes an understanding of the need for security and the actions required of users to maintain security and respond to incidents. The content also addresses the need for operations security and the handling of CUI. Security awareness techniques include displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed with security reminders, generating email advisories or notices from organizational officials, displaying logon screen messages, and conducting awareness events using podcasts, videos, and webinars. Security literacy training is conducted at a frequency consistent with applicable laws, directives, regulations, and policies. Updating literacy training content on a regular basis ensures that the content remains relevant. Events that may precipitate an update to literacy training content include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Potential indicators and possible precursors of insider threats include behaviors such as inordinate, long-term job dissatisfaction; attempts to gain access to information that is not required for job performance; unexplained access to financial resources; sexual harassment or bullying of fellow employees; workplace violence; and other serious violations of the policies, procedures, rules, directives, or practices of organizations. Organizations may consider tailoring insider threat awareness topics to roles (e.g., training for managers may be focused on specific changes in the behavior of team members, while training for employees may be focused on more general observations). Social engineering is an attempt to deceive an individual into revealing information or taking an action that can be used to breach, compromise, or otherwise adversely impact a system. Social engineering includes phishing, pretexting, impersonation, baiting, quid pro quo, threadjacking, social media exploitation, and tailgating. Social mining is an attempt to gather information about the organization that may be used to support future attacks. Security literacy training includes how to communicate employee and management concerns regarding potential indicators of insider threat and potential and actual instances of social engineering and data mining through appropriate organizational channels in accordance with established policies and procedures.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;An event is any observable occurrence in a system, including unlawful or unauthorized system activity. Organizations identify event types for which a logging functionality is needed. This includes events that are relevant to the security of systems and the environments in which those systems operate to meet specific and ongoing auditing needs. Event types can include password changes, the execution of privileged functions, failed logons or accesses related to systems, administrative privilege usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining event types that require logging, organizations consider the system monitoring and auditing that are appropriate for each of the security requirements. When defining event types, organizations consider the logging necessary to cover related events, such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented or cloud-based architectures. Monitoring and auditing requirements can be balanced with other system needs. For example, organizations may determine that systems must have the capability to log every file access — both successful and unsuccessful — but only activate that capability under specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. The event types that are logged by organizations may change over time.

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Authenticators include passwords, cryptographic devices, biometrics, certificates, one-time password devices, and ID badges. The initial authenticator content is the actual content of the authenticator (e.g., the initial password). In contrast, requirements for authenticator content contain specific characteristics. Authenticator management is supported by organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics (e.g., password complexity and composition rules, validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and the number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric authentication).

This includes passwords stored in hashed or encrypted formats or files that contain hashed or encrypted passwords that are accessible with administrator privileges. Actions can be taken to protect authenticators, including maintaining possession of authenticators, not sharing authenticators with others, and immediately reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators.  Developers may deliver system components with factory default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well-known, easily discoverable, and present a significant risk.

For mobile devices with small displays, this threat may be less significant and is balanced against the increased likelihood of input errors due to small keyboards. Therefore, the means of obscuring authenticator feedback is selected accordingly.

      <title>Password Management: Enforce the following composition and complexity rules for passwords: [Assignment: organization-defined composition and complexity rules].</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Password-based authentication applies to passwords used in single-factor or multi-factor authentication. Long passwords or passphrases are preferable to shorter passwords. Enforced composition rules provide marginal security benefits while decreasing usability. However, organizations may choose to establish and enforce certain rules for password generation (e.g., minimum character length) under certain circumstances. For example, account recovery can occur when a password is forgotten. Cryptographically protected passwords include salted one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords. The list of commonly used, compromised, or expected passwords includes passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses, dictionary words, and repetitive or sequential characters. The list includes context-specific words, such as the name of the service, username, and derivatives thereof. Changing temporary passwords to permanent passwords immediately after system logon ensures that the necessary strength of the authentication mechanism is implemented at the earliest opportunity and reduces susceptibility to authenticator compromises. Long passwords and passphrases can be used to increase the complexity of passwords.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Password-based authentication applies to passwords used in single-factor or multi-factor authentication. Long passwords or passphrases are preferable to shorter passwords. Enforced composition rules provide marginal security benefits while decreasing usability. However, organizations may choose to establish and enforce certain rules for password generation (e.g., minimum character length) under certain circumstances. For example, account recovery can occur when a password is forgotten. Cryptographically protected passwords include salted one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords. The list of commonly used, compromised, or expected passwords includes passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses, dictionary words, and repetitive or sequential characters. The list includes context-specific words, such as the name of the service, username, and derivatives thereof. Changing temporary passwords to permanent passwords immediately after system logon ensures that the necessary strength of the authentication mechanism is implemented at the earliest opportunity and reduces susceptibility to authenticator compromises. Long passwords and passphrases can be used to increase the complexity of passwords.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;</description>

      <title>Time Stamps: Record time stamps for audit records that meet [Assignment: organization-defined granularity of time measurement] and that use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), have a fixed local time offset from UTC, or include the local time offset as part of the time stamp.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Time stamps generated by the system include the date and time. Time is often expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) — a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) — or local time with an offset from UTC. The granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks (e.g., clocks synchronizing within hundreds or tens of milliseconds). Organizations may define different time granularities for system components. Time service can be critical to other security capabilities (e.g., access control and identification and authentication), depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;</description>

For example, users may only need to know how to recognize an incident or whom to call; system administrators may require additional training on how to handle incidents; and incident responders may receive specific training on data collection techniques, forensics, reporting, system recovery, and system restoration. Incident response training includes user training in identifying and reporting suspicious activities from external and internal sources. Incident response training for users may be provided as part of &lt;a href="#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_171_3_0_0/home?element=03.02.02"&gt;03.02.02&lt;/a&gt;. Events that may cause an update to incident response training content include incident response plan testing, response to an actual incident, audit or assessment findings, or changes in applicable laws, Executive Orders, policies, directives, regulations, standards, and guidelines.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;This requirement focuses on account management for systems and applications. The definition and enforcement of access authorizations other than those determined by account type (e.g., privileged access, non-privileged access) are addressed in &lt;a href="#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_171_3_0_0/home?element=03.01.02"&gt;03.01.02&lt;/a&gt;. System account types include individual, group, temporary, system, guest, anonymous, emergency, developer, and service. Users who require administrative privileges on system accounts receive additional scrutiny by personnel responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access. Types of accounts that organizations may prohibit due to increased risk include group, emergency, guest, anonymous, and temporary. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include restrictions on the time of day, day of the week, and point of origin. When defining other system account attributes, organizations consider system requirements (e.g., system upgrades, scheduled maintenance) and mission and business requirements (e.g., time zone differences, remote access to facilitate travel requirements). Users who pose a significant security risk include individuals for whom reliable evidence indicates either the intention to use authorized access to the system to cause harm or that adversaries will cause harm through them. Close coordination among mission and business owners, system administrators, human resource managers, and legal staff is essential when disabling system accounts for high-risk individuals. Time periods for the notification of organizational personnel or roles may vary. Inactivity logout is behavior- or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to log out when they are expecting inactivity longer than the defined period.

When defining other system account attributes, organizations consider system requirements (e.g., system upgrades, scheduled maintenance) and mission and business requirements (e.g., time zone differences, remote access to facilitate travel requirements). Users who pose a significant security risk include individuals for whom reliable evidence indicates either the intention to use authorized access to the system to cause harm or that adversaries will cause harm through them. Close coordination among mission and business owners, system administrators, human resource managers, and legal staff is essential when disabling system accounts for high-risk individuals.

Users who require administrative privileges on system accounts receive additional scrutiny by personnel responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access. Types of accounts that organizations may prohibit due to increased risk include group, emergency, guest, anonymous, and temporary. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include restrictions on the time of day, day of the week, and point of origin. When defining other system account attributes, organizations consider system requirements (e.g., system upgrades, scheduled maintenance) and mission and business requirements (e.g., time zone differences, remote access to facilitate travel requirements). Users who pose a significant security risk include individuals for whom reliable evidence indicates either the intention to use authorized access to the system to cause harm or that adversaries will cause harm through them. Close coordination among mission and business owners, system administrators, human resource managers, and legal staff is essential when disabling system accounts for high-risk individuals.

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Organizations apply systems security engineering principles to new development systems. For legacy systems, organizations apply systems security engineering principles to system modifications to the extent feasible, given the current state of hardware, software, and firmware components. The application of systems security engineering principles helps to develop trustworthy, secure, and resilient systems and reduce the susceptibility of organizations to disruptions, hazards, and threats. Examples include developing layered protections; establishing security policies, architectures, and controls as the foundation for system design; incorporating security requirements into the system development life cycle; delineating physical and logical security boundaries; ensuring that developers are trained on how to build trustworthy secure software; and performing threat modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors and patterns, design patterns, and compensating controls needed to mitigate risk. Organizations that apply security engineering principles can facilitate the development of trustworthy, secure systems, system components, and system services; reduce risks to acceptable levels; and make informed risk-management decisions.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;System security plans provide key characteristics of the system that is processing, storing, and transmitting CUI and how the system and information are protected. System security plans contain sufficient information to enable a design and implementation that are unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and the subsequent determinations of risk if the plan is implemented as intended. System security plans can be a collection of documents, including documents that already exist. Effective system security plans reference policies, procedures, and documents (e.g., design specifications) that provide additional detailed information. This reduces the documentation requirements associated with security programs and maintains security information in other established management or operational areas related to enterprise architecture, the system development life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;</description>

      <title>External System Services: Implement processes, methods, and techniques to monitor security requirement compliance by external service providers on an ongoing basis.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;External system services are provided by external service providers. Organizations establish relationships with external service providers in a variety of ways, including through business partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, joint ventures, and supply chain exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external system services remains with the organization charged with protecting CUI. Service-level agreements define expectations of performance, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies, mitigations, and response requirements for instances of noncompliance. Information from external service providers regarding the specific functions, ports, protocols, and services used in the provision of such services can be useful when there is a need to understand the trade-offs involved in restricting certain functions and services or blocking certain ports and protocols.

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Remote access is access to systems (or processes acting on behalf of users) that communicate through external networks, such as the internet. Monitoring and controlling remote access methods allows organizations to detect attacks and ensure compliance with remote access policies.

Remote access to the system represents a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited by adversaries. Restricting the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote access reduces the exposure of the organization and its susceptibility to threats by adversaries. A privileged command is a human-initiated command executed on a system that involves the control, monitoring, or administration of the system, including security functions and security-relevant information. Security-relevant information is information that can potentially impact the operation of security functions or the provision of security services in a manner that could result in failure to enforce the system security policy or maintain isolation of code and data.

The definition and enforcement of access authorizations other than those determined by account type (e.g., privileged access, non-privileged access) are addressed in &lt;a href="#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_171_3_0_0/home?element=03.01.02"&gt;03.01.02&lt;/a&gt;. System account types include individual, group, temporary, system, guest, anonymous, emergency, developer, and service. Users who require administrative privileges on system accounts receive additional scrutiny by personnel responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access. Types of accounts that organizations may prohibit due to increased risk include group, emergency, guest, anonymous, and temporary. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include restrictions on the time of day, day of the week, and point of origin. When defining other system account attributes, organizations consider system requirements (e.g., system upgrades, scheduled maintenance) and mission and business requirements (e.g., time zone differences, remote access to facilitate travel requirements). Users who pose a significant security risk include individuals for whom reliable evidence indicates either the intention to use authorized access to the system to cause harm or that adversaries will cause harm through them. Close coordination among mission and business owners, system administrators, human resource managers, and legal staff is essential when disabling system accounts for high-risk individuals. Time periods for the notification of organizational personnel or roles may vary. Inactivity logout is behavior- or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to log out when they are expecting inactivity longer than the defined period. Automatic enforcement of inactivity logout is addressed by &lt;a href="#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_171_3_0_0/home?element=03.01.10"&gt;03.01.10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Access control policies control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or system processes acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (i.e., devices, files, records, domains) in organizational systems.

      <title>Information Flow Enforcement: Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of CUI within the system and between connected systems.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Information flow control regulates where CUI can transit within a system and between systems (in contrast to who is allowed to access the information) and without regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include keeping CUI from being transmitted in the clear to the internet, blocking external communications traffic that claims to be sourced from within the organization, restricting requests to the internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting CUI transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring CUI between organizations may require an agreement that specifies how the information flow is enforced (see &lt;a href="#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_171_3_0_0/home?element=03.12.05"&gt;03.12.05&lt;/a&gt;). Transferring CUI between systems that represent different security domains with different security policies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information owners or stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes prohibiting CUI transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing information access only), employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows, and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security labels. Organizations commonly use information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of CUI between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) within systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on characteristics of the information or the information path. Enforcement occurs in boundary protection devices (e.g., encrypted tunnels, routers, gateways, and firewalls) that use rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;</description>

      <title>Least Privilege: Allow only authorized system access for users (or processes acting on behalf of users) that is necessary to accomplish assigned organizational tasks.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Organizations employ the principle of least privilege for specific duties and authorized access for users and system processes. Least privilege is applied to the development, implementation, and operation of the system. Organizations consider creating additional processes, roles, and system accounts to achieve least privilege. Security functions include establishing system accounts and assigning privileges, installing software, configuring access authorizations, configuring settings for events to be audited, establishing vulnerability scanning parameters, establishing intrusion detection parameters, and managing audit information. Security-relevant information includes threat and vulnerability information, filtering rules for routers or firewalls, configuration parameters for security services, security architecture, cryptographic key management information, access control lists, and audit information.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;</description>

      <title>Supply Chain Risk Management Plan: Develop a plan for managing supply chain risks associated with the research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations, maintenance, and disposal of the system, system components, or system services.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Dependence on the products, systems, and services of external providers and the nature of the relationships with those providers present an increasing level of risk to an organization. Threat actions that may increase security risks include unauthorized production, the insertion or use of counterfeits, tampering, poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain, theft, and the insertion of malicious software, firmware, and hardware. Supply chain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system, component, or service. Managing supply chain risks is a complex, multifaceted undertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to build trust relationships and communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Supply chain risk management (SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks, determining appropriate risk response actions, developing SCRM plans to document response actions, and monitoring performance against the plans. The system-level SCRM plan is implementation-specific and provides constraints, policy implementation, requirements, and implications. It can either be stand-alone or incorporated into system security plans. The SCRM plan addresses the management, implementation, and monitoring of SCRM requirements and the development or sustainment of systems across the system development life cycle to support mission and business functions. Because supply chains can differ significantly across and within organizations, SCRM plans are tailored to individual program, organizational, and operational contexts.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;</description>

      <title>Access Control for Mobile Devices: Establish usage restrictions, configuration requirements, and connection requirements for mobile devices.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;A mobile device is a computing device with a small form factor such that it can be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection; possesses local, non-removable, or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Mobile device functionality may include on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, voice communication capabilities, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones, smart watches, and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capabilities of mobile devices may be comparable to or a subset of notebook or desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Some organizations may consider notebook computers to be mobile devices. The protection and control of mobile devices are behavior- or policy-based and require users to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which the organization provides physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting CUI. Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage restrictions, configuration requirements, and connection requirements for mobile devices include configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementing mandatory protective software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting operating system and possibly other software integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware. On mobile devices, secure containers provide software-based data isolation designed to segment enterprise applications and information from personal apps and data. Containers may present multiple user interfaces, one of the most common being a mobile application that acts as a portal to a suite of business productivity apps, such as email, contacts, and calendar.

      <title>Access Control for Mobile Devices: Implement full-device or container-based encryption to protect the confidentiality of CUI on mobile devices.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;A mobile device is a computing device with a small form factor such that it can be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection; possesses local, non-removable, or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Mobile device functionality may include on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, voice communication capabilities, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones, smart watches, and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capabilities of mobile devices may be comparable to or a subset of notebook or desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Some organizations may consider notebook computers to be mobile devices. The protection and control of mobile devices are behavior- or policy-based and require users to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which the organization provides physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting CUI. Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage restrictions, configuration requirements, and connection requirements for mobile devices include configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementing mandatory protective software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting operating system and possibly other software integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware. On mobile devices, secure containers provide software-based data isolation designed to segment enterprise applications and information from personal apps and data. Containers may present multiple user interfaces, one of the most common being a mobile application that acts as a portal to a suite of business productivity apps, such as email, contacts, and calendar. Organizations can employ full-device encryption or container-based encryption to protect the confidentiality of CUI on mobile devices.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;</description>

      <title>Wireless Access: Authorize each type of wireless access to the system prior to establishing such connections.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Wireless networking capabilities represent a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited by adversaries. Establishing usage restrictions, configuration requirements, and connection requirements for wireless access to the system provides criteria to support access authorization decisions. These restrictions and requirements reduce susceptibility to unauthorized system access through wireless technologies. Wireless networks use authentication protocols that provide credential protection and mutual authentication. Organizations authenticate individuals and devices to protect wireless access to the system. Special attention is given to the variety of devices with potential wireless access to the system, including small form factor mobile devices (e.g., smart phones, tablets, smart watches). Wireless networking capabilities that are embedded within system components represent a potential vulnerability that can be exploited by adversaries. Strong authentication of users and devices, strong encryption, and disabling wireless capabilities that are not needed for essential mission or business functions can reduce susceptibility to threats by adversaries involving wireless technologies.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Security-related system property includes hardware authentication tokens, system administration technical manuals, keys, identification cards, and building passes. Exit interviews ensure that terminated individuals understand the security constraints imposed by being former employees and that accountability is achieved for the organizational property. Security topics at exit interviews include reminding individuals of potential limitations on future employment and non-disclosure agreements. Exit interviews may not always be possible for some individuals, including in cases related to the unavailability of supervisors, illnesses, or job abandonment. The timely execution of termination actions is essential for individuals who have been terminated for cause. Organizations may consider disabling the accounts of individuals who are being terminated prior to the individuals being notified. This requirement applies to the reassignment or transfer of individuals when the personnel action is permanent or of such extended duration as to require protection. Protections that may be required for transfers or reassignments to other positions within organizations include returning old and issuing new identification cards, keys, and building passes; changing system access authorizations (i.e., privileges); closing system accounts and establishing new accounts; and providing access to official records to which individuals had access at previous work locations in previous system accounts.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;</description>
